title: Choosing a Coding Boot Camp
---

Before joining Bloc’s Part Time Web Developer Track, I spent a significant amount of time researching various boot camp options, including online and in person camps. Coming from a non-tech background, a lot of time and energy went into figuring out what path I wanted to pursue and the questions I asked were numerous. What programming skills were in demand and would likely still be in demand once my apprenticeship was over? Would the program prepare me for an actual job in development? Could I learn the material on my own instead of shelling out thousands of dollars? The list of questions went on and on. By the time I finally shared my desire to attend a coding boot camp with my friends and family, I had already been in research mode for months and had narrowed my boot camp requirements down to 3 key factors:

1.	Budget (time and monetary)
2.	Material covered
3.	Student outcomes

While there were multiple points to consider, the three I just listed were the most important in my case. 

Regarding the first point, budget, this was the largest consideration. As a husband and a father to two young children, my time is always limited. When I complete one task, I’m onto the next one with little break in between. When it came to choosing a boot camp, it was important to me that the curriculum be something I could manage with my time constraints, but also be reasonably priced. 

If you are reading this blog post, it is likely that you are in a boot camp now or are considering your options. With that said, you are likely finding that boot camp costs can be steep and are often times cost-prohibitive. That was exactly what I ran into and it was easy to feel discouraged. There was no way I could live within my means and then fork out $15-20K to further my education. Bloc was a great alternative for me due to i’s lower price ($8,800.00 at the time) and its reasonable duration of 6 months. 

As far as what material was covered, when I first started considering coding as a potential career path, I had no idea what the difference between frontend, backend, and a full stack developer was or how it would all work together. I did my research on that topic and while I immediately gravitated toward the design aspects of frontend development, it only made logical sense to me to also know the backend part well enough to tie my skills together. Bloc offers a great part time Web Development curriculum that provides hands on skills training in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, and Ruby. 

Finally, I wanted to know I was choosing a boot camp that had proven results for its students. What good is a boot camp if it doesn’t prepare you for the real-world or if it doesn’t have the ability to transition its students from apprentices to working developers? This part of the equation wasn’t as straight forward as my budget and curriculum considerations as most boot camps don’t publish their numbers. For example, I wanted to know information regarding retention rates, the percentage of students finding work post-graduation, the type of work students found (was it actually programming?), and the base salary of graduates. I found a lot of information pertaining to this readily available in Bloc’s FAQ guide and through Bloc’s Blog on the issue here. While the blog article is now outdated, I found it encouraging that Bloc had a 90% graduation rate and that students were finding work in their desired field.

Overall, I believe that Bloc was the right path for me as far as a boot camp was concerned. Nothing beats a structured, reasonably priced curriculum with a mentor on hand to guide you when things get sticky.
